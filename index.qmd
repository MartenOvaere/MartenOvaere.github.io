I am an assistant professor (docent) of energy economics at the [Department of Economics](https://www.ugent.be/) of Ghent University, working on electricity markets, demand flexibility (electric vehicles and heat pumps), grid tariffs, and renewable energy policy. My research combines high-frequency public and private electricity data, field experiments, and policy evaluation to study how behavior and market design affect the energy transition.
