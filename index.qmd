Welcome! I am an assistant professor (docent) at the
[Department of Economics](https://www.ugent.be/) of Ghent University. My research interests lie in energy and environmental economics, with a focus on the energy transition, electricity markets, electricity demand flexibility (electric vehicles and heat pumps), electric grids, and renewable energy (solar and wind), using empirical analysis of public and private data.
